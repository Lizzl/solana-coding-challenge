# Solana Epoch Data Analysis Coding Exercise

### Task

You should focus on voting rewards data for epoch 598 (assuming the current epoch is 599).
Your script must calculate and output the following statistics:
 - The total amount of voting rewards distributed.
 - The maximum voting reward received by a single validator.
 - The minimum voting reward received by a single validator.
 - The mean (average) voting reward amount.
 - The median voting reward amount.

Identify the validator (vote account) that received the largest absolute commission in SOL. This refers to the total commission amount, not the commission rate.
